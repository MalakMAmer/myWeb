# My First Web Page

This is my very first full webpage built entirely using **HTML** and **CSS**.  
It's a simple, static web page designed to showcase what Iâ€™ve learned so far in front-end development.

## What I learned:
- Structuring a complete webpage with HTML5
- Styling with CSS3 (Flexbox)
- Building responsive layouts from scratch

## What's inside:
- Home page layout
- Navigation bar
- Basic design

> This project marks the beginning of my web development journey. More to come!
